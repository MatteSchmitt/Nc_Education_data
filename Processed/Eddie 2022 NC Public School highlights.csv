North  Carolina  provides  supplemental  funding  to  systems  whose  ability  to,,,,,,,,,,,,
generate local revenue per student is below the state average. Some of the,,,,,,,,,,,,
"factors used to determine eligibility are county adjusted property tax base, square",,,,,,,,,,,,
"miles in the county, and per capita income. There are 69 “Low Wealth” counties",,,,,,,,,,,,
(77 LEAs) in 2021-22.,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
Counties containing a base of the Armed Forces of the United States that have an,,,,,,,,,,,,
"average daily membership of more than 17,000 students shall not receive less",,,,,,,,,,,,
supplemental low-wealth funding than the LEA received in the 2012-13 fiscal year.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Carolina.  A Charter School is a public school operated as a semi-autonomous school of,,,,,,,,,,,,
"choice, operating under a charter with the State Board of Education.  The final approval",,,,,,,,,,,,
on all charters is granted by the State Board of Education.  Charter Schools are designed,,,,,,,,,,,,
to give significant autonomy to individual schools and in turn to hold these schools,,,,,,,,,,,,
accountable for results.,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
For,"2021-22,  North  Carolina  has  204  operating  Charter  Schools.  Senate  Bill  8  (2011)",,,,,,,,,,,
